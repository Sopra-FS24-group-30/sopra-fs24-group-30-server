### Websockets
We integrated websockets in our web game, to ensure real-time communication between the client and the server.
The, by SPRING boot provided, websockets create a state or a connection between the client and backend. 
Compared to REST APIs which needs to send a request to get a response from the backend, by using websockets it is possible to 
send responses from the backend without necessarilly being called upon. Furthermore, the user can receive userscpecific information
which is not only important to send different winconditions to different clients, but also because strengthens our system.
The websockets are being configured as soon as the server is being started. As soon as the user either creates or joins a game, he is being
connected with the websockets, and his session as well as user ID is being safed in a hashmap in the backend, to send user specific requests.
